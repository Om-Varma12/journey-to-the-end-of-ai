# Journey to the End of AI

A phase-by-phase journey into modern AI systems — from sequence models to autonomous agents and production-grade GenAI infrastructure.

This repository documents my progression toward becoming a **GenAI systems engineer**.  
Each phase contains theory notes, implementations, and real projects that build toward production-ready AI systems.

This is not a tutorial dump.  
Every topic is only marked complete when it is **understood, implemented, and used in a working system**.
