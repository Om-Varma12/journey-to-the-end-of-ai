# Journey to the End of AI

A phase-by-phase journey into modern AI systems — from sequence models to autonomous agents and production-grade GenAI infrastructure.

This repository documents my progression toward becoming a **GenAI systems engineer**.  
Each phase contains theory notes, implementations, and real projects that build toward production-ready AI systems.

This is not a tutorial dump.  
Every topic is only marked complete when it is **understood, implemented, and used in a working system**.

## 🧭 Roadmap

---

### Phase 1 — Sequence Models  
Understanding how sequence learning works from first principles: RNNs, LSTMs, attention, and the foundations that led to transformers.

### Phase 2 — Transformers & LLMs  
Deep dive into transformer architecture, GPT/BERT, tokenization, scaling, and how modern large language models function internally.

### Phase 3 — Generative AI Foundations  
System-level view of generative models: training pipelines, inference, prompting, fine-tuning, and alignment (RLHF).

### Phase 4 — Embeddings & Vector Databases  
Learning how embeddings power semantic search and how vector databases enable retrieval-based AI systems.

### Phase 5 — RAG Systems  
Building retrieval-augmented generation systems that combine LLMs with external knowledge sources for real-world applications.

### Phase 6 — LangChain Ecosystem  
Orchestrating LLM tools, chains, memory, and agents to build structured AI applications.

### Phase 8 — LangGraph  
Designing stateful, multi-step agent systems with routing, memory, and human-in-the-loop control.

### Phase 9 — Advanced RAG & AI Systems  
Moving toward production systems: evaluation, monitoring, safety, CI/CD, and scalable agent architectures.

### Phase 10 — MCP & Tooling Integration  
Connecting models to external tools, IDEs, and automation pipelines through standardized interfaces.

### Phase 11 — Portfolio Projects  
Real-world projects built across phases to demonstrate applied AI engineering capability.

## 🔵 Phase 11 — Portfolio Projects
Built in parallel.

**Projects**

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository exists to:

- track deep learning of AI systems  
- build production-grade GenAI projects  
- create a strong engineering portfolio  
- document progression publicly  

---

## ⚠️ Philosophy

A topic is complete only when:
- it can be explained without notes  
- it has been implemented  
- it has been used in a working system  

---

## 📌 Status

Work in progress.  
The journey continues.
