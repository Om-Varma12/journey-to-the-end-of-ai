# Journey to the End of AI

A phase-by-phase journey into modern AI systems — from sequence models and transformers to RAG, agents, and production-grade GenAI infrastructure.

This repository documents my progression toward becoming a **GenAI systems engineer**.  
Every phase contains notes, experiments, and real projects that build on the previous one.

The goal is not just to learn models, but to understand how real-world AI systems are designed, evaluated, deployed, and monitored.

## 🧭 Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Foundations
Math, deep learning basics, PyTorch fundamentals.

### Phase 1 — Sequence Models
RNNs, LSTM, GRU, attention, encoder–decoder.

### Phase 2 — Transformers & LLMs
Transformers, BERT, GPT, tokenization, fine-tuning.

### Phase 3 — Generative AI Foundations
Training pipeline, inference pipeline, prompt engineering, RLHF basics.

### Phase 4 — Embeddings & Vector Databases
Embeddings, similarity search, FAISS, vector DBs.

### Phase 5 — RAG Systems
Retrieval pipelines, hybrid search, reranking, memory.

### Phase 6 — LangChain Ecosystem
Tools, chains, agents, orchestration.

### Phase 7 — Agent Systems
Multi-agent workflows, planning, tool use.

### Phase 8 — LangGraph
Stateful agents, routing, debugging, human-in-the-loop.

### Phase 9 — Advanced Systems
Observability, evaluation, safety, production architecture.
